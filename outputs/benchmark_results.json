    "output": "One of the most common complaints about app performance is that Canva has become extremely slow and frequently freezes, even during basic tasks such as selecting, copying, and pasting. Users consistently report that these issues have persisted for months and are not resolved by updating or reinstalling the app. This decline in speed and responsiveness has led to significant frustration, with some users stating that the app is now \"terrible\" compared to previous versions and that it is \"not worth it\" since recent updates.\n\n> \"The app FREEZES, doing SIMPLE things like: selecting something, copying and pasting.\" \u2014 f8c057fb-0d61-5dab-a809-3ae0add2f4e5  \n> \"Canva is sooo slow very slow I updated it but it just got worse please fix this I like your app it helpful but it's just slow\" \u2014 e6c269e3-37ed-585b-994d-af0bc339491d  \n> \"for months the app has been super slow and freezes.

Users feel that the focus on innovation has caused the app to become overly complicated and less user-friendly, with basic editing tasks now taking much longer and the workflow feeling inconvenient and nerve-wracking.
