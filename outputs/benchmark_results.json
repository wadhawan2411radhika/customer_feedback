    "output": "The most common complaints about Canva's app performance focus on its slow speed and frequent freezing. Users report significant issues with the app's responsiveness, highlighting that it has become slower over time and is prone to freezing during basic tasks. This has resulted in increased frustration and inefficiency, particularly when performing simple actions like selecting, copying, and pasting. Several users specifically mention that these performance issues have persisted despite attempts to update or reinstall the app, leading to dissatisfaction and, in some cases, the decision to stop using it altogether.\n\n> \"The app FREEZES, doing SIMPLE things like: selecting something, copying and pasting.\" \u2014 f8c057fb-0d61-5dab-a809-3ae0add2f4e5  \n> \"Canva is sooo slow very slow I updated it but it just got worse please fix this I like your app it helpful but it's just slow\" \u2014 e6c269e3-37ed-585b-994d-af0bc339491d  \n> \"I stopped paying.

Users note that earlier versions were more straightforward and efficient to use, whereas now, the app requires more time and adjustments to perform tasks that were previously quicker and simpler. This regression in user experience has caused frustration, as the app requires more effort to achieve the same results.\n\n> \"It's terribly inconvenient to work, everything needs to be adjusted to seconds, it wasn't like this a year ago, it was much more convenient and simpler\" \u2014 39ac5049-44aa-5ab6-bf8d-0ca37d630428  \n> \"The app WAS much better, today it is terrible, which makes me angry!
